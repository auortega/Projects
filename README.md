# Projects

This repository contains some of the different projects I have worked on. The repository is structured by either programming language (e.g. Python) or by subject (e.g. ontologies or software engineering). Also, I have some other projects that are organized by project name (e.g. Sol y Agua Project). Each project has a ReadMe file in its root folder that contains a brief description of the contents of that folder. You can view these projects by clicking "View Projects on GitHub" above.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at or00ca[at]gmail.com

Happy Coding!
