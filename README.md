# Projects

Hi!

My name is Angel U. Ortega. I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at El Paso. I am working on my MS in Software Engineering. I will be graduating on December 16, 2017.  This repository contains some of the different projects I have worked on throughout my university career. I have more than 5 years of coding experience, the longest being in Java. The repository is structured by either programming language (e.g. Python) or by subject (e.g. ontologies or software engineering). Also, I have some other projects that are organized by project name (e.g. Sol y Agua Project). Each folder has a ReadMe file that
contains a brief description of the contents of that folder. You can view these projects by clicking "View Projects on GitHub" above.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at or00ca[at]gmail.com

Happy Coding!
