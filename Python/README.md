## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Here you can view the different projects I have worked on. My repository is organized by programming language (e.g. Python or Java) or by project focus (e.g. Software Engineering or Software Architecture). 

The purpose of this page is to showcase the code I have created and maintain it organized for easy access. If you have any questions you can contact me at or00ca[at]gmail.com

Happy Coding!
